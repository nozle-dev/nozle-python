### Fixed

- Convert RFC 3339 Feature Event timestamps to Unix seconds when sending events to Core, including timestamps produced by the OpenAI and Anthropic wrappers. Numeric timestamps remain unchanged, and malformed strings fail before the HTTP request.

### Added

- Selected-subscription options, signed plan-change quotes, and withdrawal of pending changes for merchant billing portals.
- Checkout and transition support for selected subscriptions, quote IDs, cancellation-date guards, and scoped status and verification.
